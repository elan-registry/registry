# Commit, Push, and Open a Draft PR

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

## Your task

`scripts/commit-push-pr.sh` does the git and `gh` work. Your job is to write
the commit message and the PR title and body — the script does not write
prose.

1. Write the commit message to a temp file (for example, one from
   `mktemp`).
2. Write the PR body to a second temp file.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   scripts/commit-push-pr.sh \
     --message-file <commit-message-file> \
     --title "<pr title>" \
     --body-file <pr-body-file>
   ```

   Pass `--branch <name>` only if the script refuses with exit code 1
   because the current branch is `main`, `master`, or `milestone/*` — read
   its stderr message, choose a short descriptive branch name, and re-run
   with `--branch`.

4. Read the script's exit code:
   - `0` — done. Print the PR URL from its stdout.
   - `1` — refused (bad branch or a forbidden path in `docs/plans/` or
     `_noupload/`). Stop and report the reason to the user; do not retry
     with `--branch` unless the reason was the branch check.
   - `2` — a `git` or `gh` command failed. Stop and report the script's
     stderr to the user.
   - `3` — the base branch could not be resolved. Stop and ask the user
     which branch to use, then re-run with `--base <ref>`.

Do not run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, or `gh pr create` directly —
the script owns those steps, including which files it stages, so it can
refuse to stage anything under `docs/plans/` or `_noupload/`.

PRs in this project open as draft so review/fix cycles
(`/address-pr-comments`) do not spam watchers with notifications;
`/finish-issue` marks the PR ready for review once it is clean and about to
merge.
